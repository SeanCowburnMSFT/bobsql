# DOP Feedback in SQL Server 2022

This demo will show you how to see how to get consistent performance with less CPU resources for queries that require parallel operators

## Pre-requisites

- VM or computer with 8 CPUs and at least 24Gb RAM
- SQL Server 2022 CTP 2.0
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) Version 19 Preview
- Download **ostress.exe** from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=103126

## Steps

1. Execute **configmaxdop.sql**
1. Create a directory called **c:\sql_sample_databases** to store backups and files.
1. Copy the WideWorldImporters sample database from https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/wide-world-importers-v1.0/WideWorldImporters-Full.bak to a local directory (The restore script assumes **c:\sql_sample_databases**)
1. Edit the **restorewwi.sql** script for the correct paths for the backup and where data and log files should go.
1. Execute the script **restorewwi.sql**
1. Extend the database by executing **populatedata.sql**. This will take ~13mins to execute. Because of the large transaction the log will grow to ~30Gb and the user FG will grow to about ~6.5Gb
1. Execute **dopfeedback.sql** to set QDS settings and db setting for DOP feeback (required for CTP 2.0)
1. Execute **proc.sql** to create a stored procedure
1. Execute **dopxe.sql** to create an XEvent session.
1. Use SSMS to Watch the XE session to see Live Data
1. Change the value for -S (servername) in **workload_index_scan_users.cmd** to connect to your instance of SQL Server 2022 CRP2.0.
1. Run **workload_index_scan_users.cmd** from a command prompt.
1. Observe the XEvent data. It will take about 10mins to see XXXX event which means the final DOP setting to achieve stability.
1. Cancel the workload from the cmd script
1. Run **dop_query_stats.sql** to see the changes in DOP and resulting stats. Note the small decrease in avg duration and decrease in needed CPU
1. Use Top Resource Consuming Queries report and look at Avg Duration and Avg CPU to see the steady decrease until stable.
